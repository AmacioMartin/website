        <h2>DOCUMENTS</h2>
        <h3>DEMON'S BLADE GDD</h3>
        <P>
            Concept:
            <br>
            Ano, a demon hunter, was sent on a mission to an estate out in the countryside on reports of a demon
            sighting in the area. As Ano arrives at the estate he sees that the estate and the surrounding homes are in
            ruin. There are bodies and blood everywhere and Ano determines that the demon is here and he rushes to the
            entrance. The entrance of the estate is a large door, at least 10 feet high and made of thick high quality
            wood and metals. Ano unsheathes his sword, the famous demon blade, and prepares to strike down the door to
            enter the estate and defeat the demon. Player’s will help Ano in completing his mission by completing a
            number wizard game to help Ano determine the correct number of attacks he needs to destroy the door.
            Secondly players will arrive inside the estate and confront the demon and his minions, the people from the
            surrounding homes he converted into lesser demons. Player’s will play a hidden objects game to help Ano find
            and defeat all the demons and even save a mystery character.
            <br><br>
            Questions:
            <br>
            How many strikes to break the door
            Can you find all the demons and the mystery character
            <br><br>
            Visuals:
            <br>
            The visuals will consist of hand drawings by me or AI generated images so that range of quality may vary.
            The game takes place in an alternate version of our world. The aesthetic will be similar to that of old
            Japan around the times of the samurai, the Edo period, so Ano and the areas he visits will be reminiscent of
            that time. The start screen will be Ano, the main character walking through the woods with a large estate in
            view out in the distance. After progressing past the start menu the next screen will show Ano approaching
            the estate and seeing the surrounding buildings in ruin and bodies and blood on the ground. This screen will
            provide more story for the player. After advancing to the next screen the player will approach the door to
            the estate, this will begin the number wizard game asking the player how many strikes to break the door.
            After beating the number wizard players will move into the estate where they will encounter the demon and
            his lesser demon converts, this will begin the hidden objects game where the player needs to find all the
            demons and could possibly find a hidden character. Last screen will be a win screen telling the player that
            they won and concluding the story.
            <br><br>

            Background Music:
            <br>
            The background music for the number wizard game will consist of dramatic eerie atmospheric music to
            establish the dark tone of the scene of ruined buildings and the bodies of their inhabitants on the ground.
            The background music for the hidden objects game will be intense action music to help enforce the idea that
            you are in a battle with the dangerous demons. All of the music will be royalty free or original.
